### Something to say
This is the JLU Beamer Template, which is adapted for my undergraduate thesis defense. I share this template to all of you, especially for JLUer and JLU math schoolmates. Some basic information is included in README.md, please refer to https://github.com/GEOR-TS/JLU-beamer-template. The template is also submitted to Overleaf Gallery and wait for check by officials.
